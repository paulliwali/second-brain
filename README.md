> My second brain for unforgetting the things I have learned

## Motivation
It is easy to learn new things and even easier to forget them. Without intentional repetition, it is difficult to recall code practices, useful snippets, tricky concepts when you need it.

This repo documents all the things I found useful or larger concepts I spent time learning. So when I need it again, it can serve as a quick reference for myself.

## Goals
:1st_place_medal: This document should be *accessible*, maintaining high velocity for me to find the exact thing I need is the **primary** goal.

:2nd_place_medal: The **secondary** goal is to serve as a mental library for all programing related tools.

In conjunction with my roam-second-brain, which is focused on non-programming learnings, they form the foundation for me to focus on learning and applying concepts instead of memorizing them.
