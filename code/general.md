# General Coding Principles

## Keys to writing clean functions

- How easy would it be to unit test the function
- How many lines are in a function, if it greater than 20 lines then it might be doing too many things
- What are the logical steps each function is performing, if the description is "do A then B then C", then it can probably be split into 3 functions
- Data fetching -> Data processing/transformation -> Data visualization
